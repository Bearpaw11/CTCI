Node points to left and right
Only pointing the 2 ways makes it a binary tree


Full tree is when every node points to 2 nodes or zero nodes
A perfect Tree is when the bottom layer are all filed with nodes
Complete tree is when a tree id full from left to right with no gaps 

Top Node is the parent node, the nodes the parent is point to is are the child nodes.  The child nodes on the same level are called siblings
A node that does not have any children is called a leaf. 

Always start at the top. If the value is > you go to the lest. If it smaller you go to the left. 
All node to the left will be smaller and all nodes to the right will be bigger

Big O

Find , Add  delete are all O(log n) = this assumes that the tree is full; 
lookup =O (log n)
insert = O(log n)
removes = O(log n)
